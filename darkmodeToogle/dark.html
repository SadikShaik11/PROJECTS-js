<h1>Fedrich Nietzsche</h1>
<br> 
    <p>
        Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (/ˈniːtʃə, ˈniːtʃi/;[37] German: [ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈniːtʃə] (About this
        soundlisten) or [ˈniːtsʃə];[38][39] 15 October 1844 – 25 August 1900) was a German philosopher, cultural critic
        and philologist whose work has exerted a profound influence on modern intellectual history. He began his career
        as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy. He became the youngest person ever to hold the Chair of
        Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24. Nietzsche resigned in 1879 due to
        health problems that plagued him most of his life; he completed much of his core writing in the following
        decade. In 1889, at age 45, he suffered a collapse and afterward a complete loss of his mental faculties. He
        lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death in 1897 and then with his sister Elisabeth
        Förster-Nietzsche. Nietzsche died in 1900.
